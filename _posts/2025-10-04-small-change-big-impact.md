Having been living with GenAI and thinking about the transformer and MoE, which BTW was amazingly origined in this 1991 paper [Adaptive Mixtures of Local Experts](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~fritz/absps/jjnh91.pdf), the year another [dinasour](https://www.espn.com/blog/new-york/brooklyn-nets/post/_/id/17845/old-man-pierce-delivers-playoff-daggers) got his master's degree in classical AI, I suddenly had the urge this Saturday morning to ask AI this question: "how does one come up with such seemingly small but very impactful changes? lots of systematic experiments and/or research or engineering intuition or deep thinking and reasoning?", with two follow ups:

"does change from relu to gelu also have a big impact? also give me as many additional real examples as possible."

"how does one come up with such seemingly small but very impactful changes? lots of systematic experiments and/or research or engineering intuition or deep thinking and reasoning?"
