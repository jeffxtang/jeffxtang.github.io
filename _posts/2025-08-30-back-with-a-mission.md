Another 5 years have passed. Here's a summary of what happened after I wrote in my last post "my mission statement" as “Building True AI with NLU and Common Sense":

1. I ported all my iOS and Android AI apps built with TensorFlow Mobile to PyTorch Mobile around 2021 - both platforms are long gone now but I had fun and learned a bunch on how to run all kinds AI models - CV, NLP, audio, video - on mobile devices. 

2. I registered a domain name polygbot.com (for ployglot chatbot) for my chatbot simulating a 5-year-old's NLU & NLG capabilities, worked on the chatbot using hybrid AI methods with rule-based and DL. Then I unregistered the domain name after the disruptive ChatGPT was launched in Nov 2022, literaly making my mission of 2020 “Building True AI with NLU and Common Sense" a shocking reality, albeit its imperfection.

3. I started working at Meta as a GenAI engineer in 2023 building Llama powered GenAI apps using prompt engineering, RAG, fine-tuning, and agents, as well as the course content of 3 Llama courses on Deeplearning.ai.

So many crazy things have happened since Nov 2022. So many more crazier things will happen in the coming years. I asked AI the other day about a French phrase "Y a pas de petits rôles, y a que des petits acteurs", one favirote line in my favotite French TV show Call My Agent, with the English translation "There are no small roles, only small actors." and how to have a balance of working on the most important problems the most challenging and ambitious projects versus being committed to seemingly unrelated small projects, and got the following TL;DR:

| **Big Projects**                 | **Small Tasks**                        |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Move the needle                  | Train attention, humility, consistency |
| Require focus, vision, deep work | Can build trust, team, or momentum     |
| Must be prioritized              | Should be scoped, delegated, reframed  |
| Define legacy                    | Shape character                        |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |


First time I heard of someone saying one's work path ideally should be job, career, and mission was about 10 years ago. I always remember Godfather's simple yet powerful saying "I'll reason with him" and have been fasicinated with all kinds reasoning: deductive, inductive, abductive, commonsense, causal, etc (One of my recent favorite books is Logical Chess by Irving Chernev and one graduate AI course I took was Non-monotonic Reasoning); RL or learning through trial and error is my favotite way of learning (I bought a copy of the classical RL: An Intro book in 2005 while working at Baidu doing non-AI related work then).

Let me be on a new mission for the next 5-8 years. Let me focus and keep working on open, high-impact problems in AI, starting with reasoning and modern RL for LLMs.
