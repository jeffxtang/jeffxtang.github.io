Another 5 years have passed. Here's a summary of what happened after I wrote in my last post "my mission statement" as “Building True AI with NLU and Common Sense":

1. I ported all my iOS and Android AI apps built with TensorFlow Mobile to PyTorch Mobile around 2021 - both platforms are long gone now but I had fun and learned a bunch on how to run all kinds AI models - CV, NLP, audio, video - on mobile devices. 

2. I registered a domain name polygbot.com (for ployglot chatbot) for my chatbot simulating a 5-year-old's NLU & NLG capabilities, worked on the chatbot using hybrid AI methods with rule-based and DL. Then I unregistered the domain name after the disruptive ChatGPT was launched in Nov 2022, literaly making my mission of 2020 “Building True AI with NLU and Common Sense" a shocking reality, albeit its imperfection.

3. I started working at Meta as a GenAI engineer in 2023 building Llama powered GenAI apps using prompt engineering, RAG, fine-tuning, and agents, as well as the course content of 3 Llama courses on Deeplearning.ai.

So many crazy things have happened since Nov 2022. So many more crazier things will happen in the coming years. I once asked AI about a French phrase "Y a pas de petits rôles, y a que des petits acteurs", one favirote line in my favotite French TV show Call My Agent, with the English translation "There are no small roles, only small actors." and I asked how to have a balance of working on the most important, challenging and ambitious projects versus being always willing to help on even unrelated small projects, and got the following tip:

Know Your North Star - Before you can balance anything, you need clarity on:
What are your most important long-term goals?
What kind of impact do you want to have?
What problems are worth your “life’s work”?

and the TL;DR:

| **Big Projects**                 | **Small Tasks**                        |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Move the needle                  | Train attention, humility, consistency |
| Require focus, vision, deep work | Can build trust, team, or momentum     |
| Must be prioritized              | Should be scoped, delegated, reframed  |
| Define legacy                    | Shape character                        |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |

First time I heard of someone saying one's work path ideally should be job, career, and mission was about 10 years ago. I always remember Godfather's simple yet powerful saying "I'll reason with him" and have been fasicinated with all kinds reasoning: deductive, inductive, abductive, commonsense, causal, etc (One of my recent favorite books is Logical Chess by Irving Chernev and one graduate AI course I took was Non-monotonic Reasoning); RL or learning through trial and error is my favotite way of learning (I bought a copy of the classical RL: An Intro book in 2005 while working at Baidu doing non-AI related work then).

Let me be on a new mission for the next 5-8 years. Let me focus and keep working on open, high-impact problems in AI, starting with reasoning and modern RL for LLMs.
