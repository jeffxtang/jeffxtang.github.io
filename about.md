I fell in love with the traditional symbolic AI more than two decades ago, and worked on TRANSTAR, the most sucessful English-Chinese machine translation system at the time after getting my master's degree in AI. Then the AI winter came and reality hit. I spent most of the following years on building and leading teams to develop enterprise apps, Windows apps, Internet web apps, and mobile and wearable apps, till about mid 2015 when I reconnected with AI, via Deep Learning. After a lot of dates in the evenings and on weekends, I decided in September 2016 to fully embark on my AI journey and be totally committed to it for the next decade at least. *Still crazy after all these years* seems to be the right song. Maybe I'll indeed do some damage one fine day.

The blog is about my long and exciting journey ahead, starting with my first goal of building AI solutions on mobile, towards my long-term goal of building true AI systems with natural language understanding and human-like common sense - this is one of the most important and challenging questions facing AI, and seems perfect for someone who's a little crazy and has nothing to lose to dedicate himself to.

P.S. The word "labby" in the domain name ailabby.com comes from my Labrador Retriever born in May 2015 when I reconnected with AI. I hope AI systems will be as sweet and swift as my Labby. ailabby also means ai lab and beyond: science based and engineering implementation of innovative and practical true AI systems is my ultimate goal.
