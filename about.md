Inspired by blogs such as [Andrej Karpathy's](http://karpathy.github.io/), [Chris Colah's](http://colah.github.io/) and [Pete Warden's](http://petewarden.com/), I'd like to document my own journey towards Machine Learning and AI, my unwavering passion for the next decade at least.

I fell in love with AI and NLP more than two decades ago - yes that says how old an AI dog I am, then the AI winter came, or reality hit. I spent most of last 20+ years on enterprise client server apps, Internet web apps, and mobile and wearable apps, till late 2014 when I reconnected with AI, via deep learning. After a lot of dates in the evenings and on weekends, I'm about to fully embark on the journey and be totally committed to my dream love.

*Still crazy after all these years* seems to be the right song. And maybe indeed I'll do some damage one fine day. The blog is to document my long and exciting journey ahead, with hopefully both big pictures and concrete examples, in a concise and step-by-step tutorial style. Complete, practical apps built on top of them are also planned.

So why am I doing this? For the pure love of AI, for the belief that something greater will come out AI and the pure dedicated of love of it, and for the hope that stories about the love and journey will benefit some people who share the same love for Machine Learning and AI.
