Inspired by blogs such as [Andrej Karpathy's](http://karpathy.github.io/), [Chris Colah's](http://colah.github.io/) and [Pete Warden's](http://petewarden.com/), I'd like to document my own journey towards AI, my unwavering passion for the next decade at least.

I fell in love with AI and NLP more than two decades ago - yes that says how old an AI dog I am, then the AI winter came, or reality hit. I spent most of those years on enterprise client/server apps, Windows apps, Internet web apps, and mobile and wearable apps, till about mid 2014 when I reconnected with AI, via Deep Learning. After a lot of dates in the evenings and on weekends, I'm about to fully embark on my AI journey and be totally committed to my dream love. *Still crazy after all these years* seems to be the right song. Maybe I'll indeed do some damage one fine day.

The blog is about my long and exciting journey ahead, with a problem-or-example oriented flavor. Each post will cover a real problem with solution, or a complete example project with its source code repo on Github, in a concise and step-by-step tutorial style. You can either download the apps that solve some real world AI problems, or get the repos and run the code examples yourself. I hope this will help us improve our understanding of what AI can do, how AI works, and how we can build better AI apps.

*Bon Voyage!*
