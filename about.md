Inspired by blogs such as [Andrej Karpathy's](http://karpathy.github.io/), [Chris Colah's](http://colah.github.io/) and [Pete Warden's](http://petewarden.com/), I'd like to document my own journey towards AI, my unwavering passion for the next decade at least.

I fell in love with AI and NLP more than two decades ago - yes that says how old an AI dog I am, then the AI winter came, or reality hit. I spent most of those years on enterprise client/server apps, Windows apps, Internet web apps, and mobile and wearable apps, till about mid 2014 when I reconnected with AI, via deep learning. After a lot of dates in the evenings and on weekends, I'm about to fully embark on my AI journey and be totally committed to my dream love. *Still crazy after all these years* seems to be the right song. Maybe I'll indeed do some damage one fine day.

The blog is about my long and exciting journey ahead, with a problem-oriented flavor. Each post will cover a real problem with solution, based on my experience of building completed real apps to solve the problems, in a concise and step-by-step tutorial style. I hope readers who enjoy the blogs by Andrej, Chris and Pete will also benefit from mine for its kind of different and practical problem-with-solution flavor on one hand, and our shared deep love of AI on the other.

*Bon Voyage!*
